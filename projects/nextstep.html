<h1> NextStep [in progress] </h1>

<p>
  Your dream job is not necessarily on the market. Historical data can be useful in a) finding companies you would join if they had open positions 
  and b) understanding the requirements of those jobs. NextStep provides both by displaying expired job listings.
</p>
<p>
  Job data is sourced from Indeed. A web crawler scheduled via celery grabs job pages. BeautifulSoup parses these pages inserts the listings into a 
  postgres DB. 
</p>
<p>
  Once a listing is no longer available, a Django application serves the postings on the React front-end with search is powered by eleastic.

  I'm currently actively working on NextStep
